# Who is Teaching?

This is a website that allows you to view all the professors who are currently teaching a given course this year at the University of Alberta.

The front-end is built in React JS with the Material UI library. The back-end consists of a web-scraper using Cheerio that gets data from the ualberta catalogue
along with a Rate My Professor API npm library that acts as a wrapper for website's GraphQL API
